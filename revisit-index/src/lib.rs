//! A revisit index derived from WARC records.
//!
//! Everything here exists to support revisit records: to decide whether a capture may be written
//! as one, and to name the record it refers back to. Two deliberately separate tables in one
//! SQLite database answer those two questions:
//!
//! - The payload table maps a digest to the canonical payload-bearing WARC record: the
//!   `WARC-Refers-To` target of any revisit, whether an `identical-payload-digest` revisit found
//!   the digest again or a `server-not-modified` revisit confirmed it unchanged.
//! - The resource-state table maps a resource/request identity to its HTTP validators and the
//!   digest of its prior representation. The validators drive conditional requests; the digest
//!   leads, through the payload table, to the record a `server-not-modified` revisit refers to.
//!
//! The index is derived, rebuildable state; WARC files remain the source of truth. A response
//! whose declared `WARC-Payload-Digest` is not the digest of its payload is not indexed, so a
//! wrong digest in one file does not spread through revisits into others. A database written
//! by an incompatible schema version is not migrated: delete it and index the records again.
//! This crate is intentionally unaware of WACZ. A caller may ingest records from standalone
//! WARC files, WARC streams extracted from WACZ packages, or any other source.
//!
//! Resource identity is currently one canonical GET representation per target URI. The
//! [`resource::ResourceKey`] wrapper leaves room for explicitly representing method, authorization
//! context, cookies, and `Vary`-selected request headers in a future schema. The same payload may
//! be linked to any number of independent resource keys.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use archivindex_warc::value::{Algorithm, LabelledDigest};
//! use archivindex_warc_revisit_index::Index;
//! use archivindex_warc_revisit_index::resource::ResourceKey;
//! use fluent_uri::Uri;
//!
//! let index = Index::open_in_memory()?;
//! let key = ResourceKey::new(Uri::parse("https://example.com/")?.to_owned());
//! let digest = LabelledDigest::from_digest(Algorithm::Sha256, &[0; 32]);
//!
//! assert!(index.lookup_payload(&digest)?.is_none());
//! assert!(index.lookup_resource(&key)?.is_none());
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`payload`] describes the canonical payload-bearing records a revisit can refer to.
//! - [`resource`] describes the conditional-request state a revisit is produced from.
